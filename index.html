    <p>The right fuel for your brain can help you win the fight against homework assignments and crazy exams, but it's not easy to keep track of your eating habits when the next deadline is always around the corner. Brain Food was made to provide students with
      a quick resource for healthy eating ideas, and to give students at UH Manoa information on how to buy healthy foods and ingredients near campus.</p>

    <p>As the average college student has limited time and financial means to support healthy eating in the name of brainpower, Brain Food also lists both the estimated time needed to follow a recipe from start to finish, and the estimated cost of recipe
      ingredients.</p>

    <p>Use Brain Food and activate your brain's beast mode!</p>

    <a id="initial-user-study" class="anchor" href="#landing-page" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial User Study</h2>    
    <p>Brain-Food's user study recruited UH users rmdc, kfkogasa, dexterjn, sagpaoa, and dionie as voluntary subjects for the testing of Brain-Food's user satisfaction. These test subjects were chosen by Brain-Food developers to optimize feedback variety, as subjects included students majoring in computer science as well as other areas such as mechanical engineering and biochemistry. The study was done while watching each user interact with the site while providing them encouragement for navigating the important aspects of our application, e.g. being told to add a recipe or a new location. The user then wrote down their thoughts, while the spectating Brain-Food contributer also took notes on what the user was doing.</p>
    <p>Many users had feedback that was focused positively on the theme and site artwork. Some users did say that "it’s too boring," and that the theme was redundant without moving art. On the user interface side, our users only had problems with features that had not fully been implemented yet, such as missing database integration with certain areas of the site. Armed with insights gained from Brain-Food's growing UH user community, we will look to release a new patch that will level up your Brain-Food experience to the max!</p>
